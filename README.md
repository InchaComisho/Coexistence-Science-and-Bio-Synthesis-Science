Abstract

Current global climate strategies focus primarily on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. While emission reduction is necessary, it is no longer sufficient. The Earth system has already accumulated excess heat, and at the same time, its natural carbon fixation mechanisms—soil, forests, oceans, and microbial ecosystems—are collapsing.

This paper proposes a new integrated scientific framework: Coexistence Science and Bio-Synthesis Science.
Rather than attempting to dominate or redesign nature, this framework seeks to restore and assist natural cycles based on fundamental natural laws.

All technologies required for this approach already exist and are safely deployed in society today. The primary missing element is not technology, but a unifying philosophy capable of integrating these technologies in accordance with natural law.

1. The Core Problem: Misidentification of the Root Cause

Modern climate policy largely treats global warming as a CO₂ emission problem.
This approach implicitly assumes that the planet’s natural absorption capacity remains intact.

However, this assumption is false.
	•	Soil microbial ecosystems have been severely damaged by chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and monoculture agriculture.
	•	Forest ecosystems have lost structural complexity and biodiversity.
	•	Marine ecosystems are experiencing stratification, oxygen depletion, and widespread dead zones.
	•	Coral reef systems, supporting roughly 25% of marine biodiversity, are rapidly collapsing.

These systems are not peripheral. They are the primary carbon fixation and thermal buffering mechanisms of the Earth.

Reducing emissions while allowing these systems to degrade is mathematically and physically insufficient.
It is equivalent to reducing water inflow while the reservoir itself is collapsing.

2. From Linear Thinking to Systemic Reality

Traditional engineering and policy approaches rely on linear cause–effect reasoning:

Emissions increase → Temperature rises → Reduce emissions → Temperature stabilizes

The Earth system does not behave linearly.

It operates through feedback loops:
	•	Temperature rise weakens microbial activity.
	•	Reduced microbial activity lowers carbon fixation.
	•	Lower fixation increases atmospheric CO₂.
	•	Increased CO₂ accelerates warming.

This creates non-linear, exponential acceleration beyond tipping points.

Ignoring these feedbacks results in predictions that are systematically optimistic and detached from observed reality.

3. Six Principles: The Foundation of Coexistence Science

Coexistence Science is grounded in six fundamental principles that define how sustainable systems must be designed.

1. Natural Law

Nature operates according to immutable physical and biological laws.
No technology can override them—only align with them.

2. Harmony

Human systems must coexist with natural systems, not oppose them.
Intervention should minimize disruption and maximize natural recovery.

3. Circulation

Life persists only through circulation:
	•	Water
	•	Carbon
	•	Nutrients
	•	Energy

When circulation stops, collapse follows.

4. Structure

Ecosystems are hierarchical.
Microorganisms form the foundation; all higher life depends on them.

5. Order

Order is not control, but balance—preventing runaway processes that destabilize the system.

6. Wa (Integration)

Wa represents the integration of all principles into a coherent civilizational intent:
not domination, but coexistence.

4. Coexistence Science: Definition

Coexistence Science is defined as:

A scientific framework that re-integrates human activity into natural cycles rather than placing it outside or above them.

Key characteristics:
	•	Nature is not a resource to be exploited.
	•	Ecosystems are not machines to be optimized.
	•	Restoration of natural function takes priority over artificial substitution.

5. Bio-Synthesis Science: Definition

Bio-Synthesis Science is the applied branch of Coexistence Science.

It focuses on:
	•	Temporarily assisting damaged natural processes
	•	Using technology as a support mechanism, not a replacement

Examples:
	•	Assisting vertical ocean circulation when stratification prevents nutrient flow
	•	Using evaporative cooling to dissipate excess heat
	•	Restoring microbial habitats by stabilizing temperature and moisture

Nature remains the primary actor.
Technology functions as a prosthesis, not a redesign.

6. Why Conventional Engineering Is Insufficient

Engineering excels at isolated optimization but struggles with:
	•	Complex feedback loops
	•	Multi-scale ecological interactions
	•	Long-term unintended consequences

Many environmental failures result not from bad engineering, but from engineering applied without ecological philosophy.

Coexistence Science does not reject engineering; it repositions it under natural law.

7. Climate Restoration Requires Physical Cooling

The Earth is already overheated.

Even immediate zero emissions would not remove:
	•	Stored oceanic heat
	•	Atmospheric thermal inertia
	•	Stratification-induced ecosystem collapse

Therefore, direct physical cooling—aligned with natural processes—is required to stabilize the system while restoration occurs.

This is not geoengineering in the conventional sense.
It involves no chemical alteration and no irreversible intervention.

8. Why This Framework Is Rarely Considered
	•	Scientific disciplines are excessively fragmented.
	•	Philosophical foundations are excluded from technical discourse.
	•	Dualistic thinking (human vs nature) remains dominant.

Coexistence Science requires a shift in worldview, not merely new data.

9. Conclusion

The technologies needed to stabilize and restore the Earth already exist.
The failure lies not in capability, but in civilizational philosophy.

Coexistence Science and Bio-Synthesis Science offer:
	•	A non-dualistic framework
	•	A systems-based understanding of climate dynamics
	•	A path toward planetary restoration grounded in natural law

Whether humanity chooses to adopt this framework remains uncertain.
But the physical reality of the Earth system will proceed regardless of belief.
